title: New version, new site!
---
Since the LivingStyleGuide is getting a v2, we decided to give LSG a fresh new website. It'll be easier to organize information on the v2, as well as having more styling options than in a Github readme.

Most notable, this redesign features a blog, with [@ anomiseditrix](https://twitter.com/anomiseditrix) as contributor, and we'll be including full documentation and examples for LSG.

Stay tuned for updates on LivingStyleGuide v2 releases!
